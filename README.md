CG WebP - convert images to WEBP without any external library.

CG WebP plugin helps you optimize your page load.

When a page is displayed, all images from defined formats are converted to WEBP format and stored in media/plg_system_cgwebp directory or in original images directory.

When images are updated, their webp images is updated as well.

Storing created images in media directory has the double advantages to easily locate those images and not to double save them (by making media/plg_system_cgwebp an exception in Akeeba Backup)

On your pages, webp images will be displayed, replacing original images.
